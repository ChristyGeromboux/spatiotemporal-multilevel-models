title: Compare basic regression with mixed-effects modelling
---

We will cover what is a Random Effect and how it differs from a Fixed effect. Some example syntax in R (on a secure website portal we have configured) and Stata will show how to get a handle on models that have random intercepts and additionally, random slopes.

We will spend a little time talking about how to partition variation and get estimates of the random and fixed effects. An important element will be our discussion of similarities between mixed-effects models with basic regression. There will also be brief discussion of extending the regression to non-gaussian responses (GLMERs).
